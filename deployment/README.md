# Deployment using docker and docker-compose
- you can have multiple deployment type in your project
- This case I only use production env which doesn't have hot reload for deverlopment
- Deploy mongoDB at localhost:27017; gogodo at localhost:50051
- Read Makefile for more details how dockerfile and docker-compose work
